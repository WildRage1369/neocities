        <ul>
            <li>"More! Let me hear the voice of your Pokémon!"</li>
            <li>"... I have to change the world for Pokémon, because they're my friends."</li>
            <li>"... I love Ferris wheels. The circular motion… The mechanics… They're like collections of elegant formulas."</li>
            <li>"... If your conviction is not strong enough, you will never be able to defeat me."</li>
            <li>"Chargestone Cave... I like this place. Formulas express electricity and its connection to Pokémon..."</li>

            <li>"I will show you that my love for my friends permeates every cell of my body. Behold!"</li>
            <li>
                "... I've been living with Pokémon since I was born, so it's easier for me to talk with them than with people. ...Because Pokémon never tell lies."
            </li>
            <li>
                "It's time to settle this once and for all! My determination is absolute! I will prove the value of my beliefs even if it means my Pokémon friends get hurt! Since you've come this far, I believe you are equally determined. If that's so, prove it to me! Show me the depth of your determination!"
            </li>
            <li>
                " It's not by rejecting different ideas, but by accepting different ideas that the world creates a chemical reaction. This is truly the formula for changing the world."
            </li>
        </ul>
